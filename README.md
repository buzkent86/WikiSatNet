# Learning to Interpret Satellite Images Using Wikipedia
This repository contains the implementation of our IJCAI 2019 paper "Learning to Interpret Satellite Images Using Wikipedia".

Unfortunately, as of now, we are still negotiating with DigitalGLobe to purchase the images for WikiSatNet. However, we plan on releasing the model pre-trained on WikiSatNet that boosts the accuracy on the dowstream tasks.
